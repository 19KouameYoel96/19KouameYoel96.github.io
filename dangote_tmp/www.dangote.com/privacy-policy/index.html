		  	<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Dangote Group (comprising of all DCP, DSR, and DIL business units) hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Group&#8221; is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Information about its employees, customers, business partners and other identifiable individuals.

Each employee bears a personal responsibility for complying with this Policy in the fulfillment of their responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The Group respects the privacy of its employees and third parties such as customers, business partners, vendors, service providers, suppliers, former employees, and candidates for employment and recognizes the need for appropriate protection and management of Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>This policy sets the minimum standard and shall guide all employees and Agents of the Group even if local law is less restrictive. Supplemental policies and practices will be developed as needed to meet the local legal or departmental requirements. Supplemental policies and practices may provide for more strict or specific privacy and protection standards than are set forth in this Policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Purposes consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual,</li>
<li>Purposes necessary to carry out a transaction relationship,</li>
<li>Purposes necessary to comply with legal requirements, or</li>
<li>Disclosure to an Agent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accountability for onward transfer</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of Personal Information to either an Agent or Controller, the Group strives to take reasonable and appropriate steps to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer such Personal Information only for specified purposes and limit the Agent or Controller’s use of that information for those specified purposes,</li>
<li>Obligate the Agent or Controller to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Policy,</li>
<li>Help ensure that the Agent or Controller effectively Processes the Personal Information in a manner consistent with its obligations under this Policy,</li>
<li>Require the Agent or Controller to notify the Group if the Agent or Controller determines it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by this Policy, and</li>
<li>Upon notice from the Agent or Controller, take further steps to help stop and remediate any unauthorized Processing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The Group takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the Processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</strong></p>
<p>The Group will only Process Personal Information in a way that is compatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. The Group shall take steps to help ensure that Personal Information is accurate, reliable, current, and relevant to its intended use.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>The Group provides individuals with reasonable access to their Personal Information for purposes of correcting, amending, or deleting that information where it is inaccurate or has been Processed in violation of the Group’s data privacy principles.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recourse, Enforcement and Liability</strong></p>
<p>Violation of this Policy by an employee or contractor of the Group will result in appropriate discipline up to and including termination. Violation by an Agent, Controller or other third party of this Policy will result in the exercise of appropriate legal remedies available at law or in equity including termination for material breach of contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
